I'm a student at Riga State Gymnasium No. 3, there I broadly study physics,
programming and mathematics. In my free time I try to educate myself
further by attending events such as `Make Rīga`_ programming sessions and
`Junior Physics Academy`_.

When not educating myself, I play the accordion and make works of art.
