I'm a latvian student at `Riga State Gymnasium No. 3`_, where I broadly study
physics, programming and mathematics. In my free time I try to educate
myself further by making `blogs`_, configuring servers, programming
physics `simulations`_ and making simplistic games. I've also worked at
`Scandiweb`_ and am a frequent at `Junior Physics Academy`_.

When not educating myself, I play the accordion and creatively express
myself on `Instagram`_. I also ride the `bicycle`_ and play volleyball.
