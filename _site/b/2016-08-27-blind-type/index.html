<p><p>I was at home an hour till midnight. Minutes before I had had a chat and drank a beer with Nick. My bedroom was a mess, because I was planning to repaint the ceilings and walls.</p>
<p>I was sitting in the dark, doing my daily Facebook and mail checks (the lights had to be removed to make painting easier). I kind of wanted to go to sleeep and in preperation decided to make my laptop’s screen a bit dimmer. Tried dimming it with native ‘fn’ buttons, but it was still too bright. Decided to do it with some Googled commands.</p>
<pre><code>xbacklight -set 50</code></pre>
<p>There you go, a nice command. Let’s try a few experimental settings. <code>xbacklight -set 5</code> - nope, way too bright, <code>xbacklight -set 2</code> - still bright, <code>xbacklight -set 1</code> - bright.. Something isn’t right. Let’s splash out a little. Let’s get funky! <code>xbacklight -set 0.5</code>? Yeah, this ought to do it. <em>Click</em> - damn.. The screen went pitch black. Can’t see a thing.</p>
<p>Now sitting in the dark.. Confused. Eyes starting to get accustomed to the newfound darkness, starting to adapt and see silhouettes.. I tried closing the laptop and opening it once again. For a split second the screen regained it’s brightness.. and then turned pitch black again..</p>
<p>Right now I had two options - 1) Accept that I had failed and restart my computer in hopes it restarts the screen brightness settings. Or! 2) Do the most awesome, cool #dope #swag thing I could’ve ever done.</p>
<p>In the dark without seeing any of the keys on my keyboard nor anything on my screen, I type in my password, log in, open a terminal and retype the command precisely as I had just learned it and hope to God that everything works as expected.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And I god damn did it.</p>
