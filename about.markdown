I'm a latvian student at [Riga State Gymnasium No.3](http://www.r3g.lv/),
where I broadly study physics, programming and mathematics. In my free
time I try to educate myself further by making [blogs](../), configuring
servers, programming physics [simulations](http://github.com/kshaa/orbitals/)
and making simplistic games. I've also worked at [Scandiweb](http://scandiweb.com/)
and am a frequent at [Junior Physics Academy](http://jfs.lu.lv/).

When not educating myself, I play the accordion and creatively express
myself on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/dope_spicegirls/). I also
ride the [bicycle](http://facebook.com/nightrideriga/) and play
volleyball.
