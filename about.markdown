I'm a latvian student studying at [Riga State Gymnasium No. 3](http://www.r3g.lv/).
I'm interested in physics, programming and music. I sing in a choir, walk with shorts
in winter and quite often like to [get jiggy with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JcmQONgXJM).
I have gained some of my awesome programming skills by working at [Scandiweb](http://scandiweb.com/)
as a web developer on [LashAffair](http://lashaffair.com/) and have explored physics
by being a frequent at [Junior Physics Academy](http://jfs.lu.lv/).

When not doing very important bussiness stuff, I creatively express myself on such social platforms as
[Insta](http://instagram.com/brokastu_mellene/)[gram](http://instagram.com/dope_spicegirls/)
and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blokflautijs/), attend 
[weekly bike rides](http://facebook.com/nightrideriga/), play volleyball and much more!
