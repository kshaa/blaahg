I'm a latvian student studying at [Riga State Gymnasium No. 3](http://www.r3g.lv/). I'm interested in physics, programming and music. I also sing in a choir, walk with shorts in winter and act like I know more than I actually do. I have gained some of my awesome programming skills by working at [Scandiweb](http://scandiweb.com/) as an overall web developer on [LashAffair](http://lashaffair.com/) and have explored physics by being a frequent at [Junior Physics Academy](http://jfs.lu.lv/).

When not working, I creatively express myself on such social platforms as [Insta](http://instagram.com/brokastu_mellene/)[gram](http://instagram.com/dope_spicegirls/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blokflautijs/), attend [weekly bike rides](http://facebook.com/nightrideriga/), play volleyball, etc!
